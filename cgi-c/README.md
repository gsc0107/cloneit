The following directory contains the (OLD!) sources for the CGI-version of CloneIt I wrote in ~1998.
The files were kindly sent by David Mathog (caltech) in 2014 because... well... my old sources must be somewhere...

So you want to install CloneIt...

OK. CloneIt was my very first program written in C a few years
ago... At that time I didn't known much about C and makefile.
please be indulgent with my old program :)

Im' now working as a professional scientific programmer
in C/C++ and, when I've got time (which is never) I'm
working on the standard C++ version of CloneIt.

The CGI-C version 2.2 should compile on any C standard
compiler.

You will have to change the first macros in the makefile in
order to change the targets.

Then: 'make install'.

May be you will have to move the files 'CloneIt_Help.html' and 'example.html'
in order to be seen by apache.
