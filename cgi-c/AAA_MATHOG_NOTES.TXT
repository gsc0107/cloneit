Notes 05-JUN-2014 David Mathog
This software broke somewhere along the line, perhaps due to changes in the
browsers/web server.  Had to modify the binary to make it work again.
The problem concerns HTML input "range" types.  Older browsers put up a box
and returned 0 if the user didn't enter anything.  Newer browsers put up
a slider and return (min+max)/2 if the user doesn't enter anything.  Binary
now expects 2nd behavior, just put a big warning in the HTML not to use
older style browsers.

Notes 28-APR-2010 David Mathog
default file protections on linux tighter than on solaris.  Results
in some of the files being 600 and the web server can't read them, results
in an obscure "SERVER ERROR" message, with nothing in the server log files.
After make, do
  chmod g+r *
  chmod o+r *
and it takes care of it.

Changes 17-AUG-2002, David Mathog

1.  foo_.html -> foo.html_  (this allowed a trivial "install" in the makefile).
2.  fixed various problems in head.html (mailto: where it shouldn't have been)
3.  Added explicit path to cloneitcgi in some places, else example.html
    failed because it directed to cgi in same directory as that file.
4.  Modified makefile so that normal build does NOT install by default.
5.  Added a few more explicit paths in makefile and some of the .html_ files.

After that it installed and worked with just:

% make
% make install

Not fixed yet:  The use of trailing "/" is not uniform, so some paths/URLS are
ending up with "foo/blah" and others "foo//blah".  Both work, but it should be
cleaned up anyway (at some point).
